# Contributing to the Global Apothecary

**Welcome, Field Medic.**

You are entering the operational backend of Meditators Without Borders. This repository holds our Constitution, our Governance models, and most importantly, our **Clinical Protocols**.

We are open-source, but we are not "open-season." Because we deal with human nervous systems in crisis, the bar for contribution is high. We function less like a social club and more like a medical review board.

## ⚕️ Protocol Improvement Proposals (PIPs)

We treat changes to this repository as **PIPs**. Whether you are fixing a typo in the Oath or introducing a new Breathwork technique, you must follow the **PIP Workflow**:

1.  **Fork** the repository.
2.  **Branch** specifically (e.g., `protocol/box-breathing-update` or `governance/vote-quorum-change`).
3.  **Draft** your changes using the Standards below.
4.  **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**.
5.  **Peer Review:**
    * *Governance PRs* require a quorum of DAO members to signal intent.
    * *Protocol PRs* require verification by 2 "Attending" level Medics.

## 🧘 Contributing New Clinical Protocols

This is the most critical section. We do not accept "new age" theories without rigorous grounding. If you wish to add a technique to `PROTOCOLS/Somatic_Intervention/`, it must adhere to the **Somatic Safety Standard**.

**Your PR must include a Markdown file structured as follows:**

### 1. The Mechanism of Action
* **Physiological Target:** (e.g., Vagus Nerve, HPA Axis, CO2 tolerance).
* **Polyvagal State:** Does this move a user from *Dorsal* to *Ventral*, or *Sympathetic* to *Ventral*?
* **Time to Efficacy:** (e.g., "Effects typically felt within 90 seconds").

### 2. The Script
* Exact, concise verbal cues a Field Medic should use.
* *Requirement:* Must be culturally neutral (strip away religious or lineage-specific jargon where possible).

### 3. Contraindications (The "Black Box" Warning)
* **When NOT to use this.**
* *Example:* "Do not use rapid Kapalabhati breathwork with users reporting panic attack symptoms, as it may increase hyper-arousal."

## ⚖️ Contributing to Governance

Changes to `CONSTITUTION/` or `GOVERNANCE_PROCESSES/` define how we operate as a DAO.

* **Minor Changes:** (Typos, clarifications) -> Merged by Maintainers.
* **Major Changes:** (Voting thresholds, $PRSNC allocation, Scope of Practice) -> Must be accompanied by a **governance vote ID** from our voting platform.
    * *Note:* You cannot merge a change to the Constitution without an on-chain vote proving the community approved it.
