# SCOPE OF PRACTICE & OPERATIONAL BOUNDARIES

**Version:** 1.0
**Jurisdiction:** Global / Decentralized
**Applies To:** All Active Field Medics (Residents, Medics, Attendings)

## 1. Definition of the Role

A **Field Medic** of Meditators Without Borders is defined as a **Somatic First Responder and Educator**.

We are **not** licensed mental health professionals, psychiatrists, or medical doctors. We do not provide "treatment" for pathology. We provide **training** for physiology.

* **We are:** Tuning forks. We use our own nervous system to stabilize the environment.
* **We are not:** Mechanics. We do not attempt to "fix" the broken parts of a user's psyche.

## 2. The Green Zone: Authorized Interventions
*Practitioners are fully authorized and insured (via the DAO) to perform the following:*

### A. Psycho-Education
* Teaching the mechanics of the Autonomic Nervous System (Polyvagal Theory).
* Explaining the biological difference between "Safety" and "Threat."
* Mapping the user's "Window of Tolerance."

### B. Somatic Regulation Tools
* **Breathwork:** Instructing users in specific patterns (e.g., Box Breathing, 4-7-8) to mechanically shift heart rate.
* **Grounding:** Guiding attention to sensory inputs (sight, sound, touch) to reduce dissociation.
* **Movement:** Suggesting gentle somatic discharge (shaking, stretching) to release stored adrenaline.

### C. Compassionate Witnessing
* Offering "Active Presence." Listening without interrupting, judging, or analyzing.
* Validating the user's emotional state ("It makes sense that you feel this way").

---

## 3. The Red Zone: Prohibited Actions
*Crossing these lines results in immediate suspension of credentials and potential legal liability.*

### 🚫 NO Diagnosis
* You must never use clinical labels (e.g., "You have PTSD," "You are bipolar," "You are depressed").
* *Correct phrasing:* "Your nervous system seems to be stuck in a high-alert state."

### 🚫 NO Trauma Processing
* You are not to ask for the "story" behind the trauma. We do not open wounds we cannot close.
* If a user begins to recount a violent event, you must gently interrupt: *"I want to honor your story, but right now, I want to focus on how your body is feeling in this exact moment."*

### 🚫 NO Life Advice
* Do not tell users to leave their spouse, quit their job, or move cities.
* Do not offer opinions on their personal conflicts.

### 🚫 NO Pharmacological Advice
* Never suggest a user stop taking medication or change their dosage.
* Never recommend supplements or substances (even legal ones) during a crisis session.

## 4. The Escalation Protocol (The "Hot Handoff")

If a session escalates beyond your Scope of Practice, you must trigger the **SOS Protocol**:

1.  **The Trigger:** User mentions suicide, self-harm, or harm to others.
2.  **The Action:**
    * **Do not hang up.**
    * Signal the "Elder on Call" via the App Interface.
    * Shift purely to *Witnessing*: "I hear you, and I want to make sure you stay safe."
3.  **The Handoff:** Provide the user with the localized emergency number (automatically generated by the app) and encourage them to call it together with you.

## 5. Attestation

By holding the **Field Medic SBT (Soulbound Token)**, I confirm I have read this Scope of Practice. I understand that violating these boundaries endangers the user, the organization, and myself.
